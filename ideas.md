# Champions
2 champions sounds like a start:
1. Soldier
    1. classic rifle
    2. shotgun
    3. dash
    4. grenade
2. Engineer (summoner?)
    1. primary?
    2. target (ability to lock a target and it takes more damage from robots)
    3. mobility?
    4. robot summon

Divide skills into:
- attacks (governed by attack speed)
- abilities (governed by ability cooldown)

Also maybe devide those into damage types (like piercing, slashing, ...)

That might give a nice dimension of character development.
There might be items pretty much useless on one champion and ideal on another.

Implement Hazard(active, power) Component which deduces health
